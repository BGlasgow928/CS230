Question  1: Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

For this project I was asked to develop a drawing based game called Draw It or Lose It. The client, The Gaming Room requested of me that the game be available to play across all major platforms like Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, etc. They requested that the game have multiplayer capabilities as well as having aa good storage for accessing a library of 200 photos. Completeing this task, I felt, was best done as a cloud based game.



Question 2: What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel like one of the things I did rather well in developing the documentation was knowing/reasearching the benefits and setbacks of using developing and hosting on a certain platform. I found this part pretty fascinating being that before I reasearched this I didn't know much about liscensing and hosting. I found that a lot of people actually prefer to use Linux for their hosting needs. I feel that I accelled at this because I was able to effectively find the information I needed



Question 3: What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I found the process of working through a design document very helpful in developing the code. Using th design document allowed me to better lay out and understand what is required/expected of me by the client in terms of the game. I feel that the use of the part of the design document pertaining to the requirements set forth by the client helped me best understand what was being asked for. Secondly I also found the section including the perks/setbacks of each platform helpful as well in coming up with my reccommendations for project 3.



Question 4: If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Personally, I would revise the reccomendations section. I understand that this is a part I actually scored well on but I feel that given the time I would likely use it to expand upon my reccoomendations and why I reccomended those things. I feel that this would not only allow me to reflect and better understand why I reccomended but allow me to reflect also on whether or not my reccomendation was actually the best possible reccomendation that I could have given.




Question 5: How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I know that when it comes to designing a game the number one issue is making sure it works. If you spend time downloading a game just for you to open it and it does not work it can get very frustrating for the user. In my project I felt that the cloud setup and robust storage needs were the two most important items when It came to user requirements. I chose to focus on the cloud setup so that the game would not need to be taken down to perform routine maintnence and I focused on a robust storage so that the pictures may be easily and quickly found and retrieved so that it does not make the game feel "Clunky"



Question 6: How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Like in the earlier questions I feel that I approached designing this software with an open mind. I feel that it is important before you ecen begin to code that  you understand what the client wants with its software. You can create the most amazing well working software ever but if it doesn't do what the client wants it to do then that kind of negates the whole purpose. So with that being said I feel that a strategy I would carry over is the use of a design document before I begin to code is a neccesity so that I can best understand what the client is looking for as well as what the best way for me  to "give them what they want".
